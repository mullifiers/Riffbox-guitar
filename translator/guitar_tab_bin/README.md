# unityrun

*cross-platform app *
*unity build*

*an abstract from Parneet's Dream, we watched together...*
>should have implemented it before in SE, regrets wasn't able to try my lvl best in winning that argument against sir


it is intended for unifying all the people around (even 7 seas apart ) to provide motivation for them to run (or jog) in order to kill obesity or remain physically fit n active


this app is real-time multiplayer platform and is integrated with facebook much alike the famous, 8-ball pool game.
if n number of players are playing at a given instance,
each 1 of them will receive phychologic remarks n tricks such as :-

1. 5m 4m 3m 1m to beat {player name}
2. congratulations on crossing over
3. {player name} is walking and got his/her points reduced by {count}  ;P


there will be a showcase of certain tracks to choose from and
each'll have some different kind of challenege: 

1. basis on number of jumps one has to perform in between to score more points
2. runnning speed consistency
3. beating maximum speed with sprint
4. more to be added.....


after selection of track from main menu, one can send invites through facebook n check if the opponent is online or not otherwise notification will be sent.

once the opponent clicks on __accept__ , the game starts when both the players are __ready__ 




>In second iteration of the software (may be not in current semester), we also intend to implement a feature request ie. concept of virtul __AI__  based players with difficulty selection available, also aided with some recommendations according to height and weight ratio of the user.
The scenerio shall seem like a real person playing as an opponent by having humanly variations of speed and even stats like heart beats per minute , if the hardware allows 



__** it is meant to be used with earphones with considerable volume though obviously XD__
